# Software Design 
In order to run the application, you need to run the executable jar file which is in the "Executable_Jar" folder. Inside this folder resource folder also exist so do not try to run the executable jar outside of this folder.

In any case if jar file do not work as planned, you can run the application in the intellij by updating following paths in the code:

DrumSequence.java -> line 62-63 -> update the path of the resources folder

DrumMachineMain.java -> line 168-169 -> update the path of the resources folder

SoundFactory.java -> line 27-30 to line 33-36 -> update the path of the resources folder
